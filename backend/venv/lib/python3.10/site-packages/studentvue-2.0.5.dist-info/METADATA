# StudentVue API
![travis](https://travis-ci.com/kajchang/StudentVue.svg?branch=master)
![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/studentvue.svg)

This repository provides a easy way to access data from StudentVue portals in Python programs.

This project recently transitioned to using the SOAP API from the app instead of the web-based one. Using the SOAP API is much faster, consistent, and more lightweight. However, the APIs are not compatible, so if you need compatibility the web-based one, run `pip install studentvue==1.3.2`.

See documentation on the underlying SOAP API [here](https://github.com/StudentVue/SOAPI-Docs).

## Logging In

`pip install studentvue` or clone / download the repository and `python setup.py install`.

```python
from studentvue import StudentVue
sv = StudentVue('username', 'password', 'domain name') 
```
